## Course Description

This course is designed to provide students with the skills to build cloud-based applications that provide answers using spatial data analytics and visualizations. There will be a strong emphasis on open source tools although we will also strongly rely on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.

Besides the technologies used in class, we will be using large and sometimes messy data from which we will be deriving insights from how people move around in their environments. One such dataset is [SafeGraph's human mobility data](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs). We will be combining data like this with OpenStreetMap, US Census, and datasets on open data portals.

The class is divided into four modules:

1. Spatial Analytics with Databases -- learn the basics of SQL and PostGIS for exploring datasets and answering questions of your data
2. Python and SQL -- building basic applications with queries and interacting with web services/APIs programmatically
3. Creating an API -- use Python to create a basic API that queries a PostGIS database
4. Building a cloud-based application -- build a full-fledged application in the cloud

## Format

The course will be divided between lectures on Tuesdays and labs on Thursdays. To accommodate the different time zones students will be in, a separate lab will be scheduled.

## Assignments

There will be assignments with some lectures. Other lectures will have recommended readings and suggested exercises to give additional practice, but these will be optional.

The final project will be the culmination of all of the skills learned in the class. Students will build an application that has a custom backend (e.g., PostGIS database) hosted on the cloud that can be publicly accessed and returns custom responses based on user feedback. Expectations are that API responses will be communicated in multiple ways: a static chart or map, interactive map, and formatted statistics.

## Grading

* Homeworks: 35%
* Participation: 15%
* Final Project Proposal: 10%
* Final Project: 40%

## Software

Most software used in class will be free and open source. This includes the scientific Python software stack and PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, among other tools. We will also be using cloud services like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, both of which offer a free tier and/or sufficient free credits for doing course work.

## Course Data

Some of the data we are using in this course is proprietary and cannot be openly disseminated. Students will be provided with access to our private class repository of datasets. Derivative insights based on these datasets can be openly shared, especially as part of final project work.

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to comply with and be familiar with [Penn's Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity).

When writing software, it is common to copy and paste small code snippets from online sources without citation. For larger samples, it is expected that the source is cited in the code base. In case there is uncertainty, speak with your instructor for guidance.
